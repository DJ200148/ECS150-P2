Excellent report

Report includes great details and insight about the submitted code and really helps understand the implementation even before reading it.

Report typically contains many paragraphs organized with a hierarchy of titles, addressing the different aspects of the implementation. Report includes the following items:

High-level description of implementation
Justification of design choices
Explanation of limitations
Proper file formatting
Markdown syntax
80 characters per line max
Correct spelling and grammar






What we got last time:

Grading comment:
Satisfactory report

Report suffers from a few important flaws. It typically contains a few, somewhat organized, paragraphs that mostly describes what the implementation does, but offers little insight about how the implementation works and is organized.
